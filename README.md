## Watson

How do you know if a website can be trusted for **safe online shopping?** 

Well, in most cases, you don't. That's why our mobile app, [Watson](https://www.watsontool.me/), was created.

### Key features 

* Identifies https-protected sites
* Checks if the website is being verified on Trustpilot, a digital platform that allows customers to review a business.
* Publishes the websites Scamdoc-score. Scamdoc is a web tool that evaluates "digital identities" reliability.
